Wyzer Roadmap v3 (Canonical)
Phase 0 — Non-negotiables (locked)

Local-first, offline

Always-listening hotword

Modular tools

Headless first

Voice → Brain → Tools → Voice

No cloud dependency required 

to keep in mind

Core Engine (already done)
Phase 1 — Skeleton

Project structure, boot logs, clean entrypoint. 

to keep in mind

Phase 2 — Audio pipeline stability

Mic stream, VAD, hotword, state machine: IDLE→LISTENING→THINKING→SPEAKING. 

to keep in mind

 

WYZER_DOCUMENTATION

Phase 3 — STT (single engine)

Faster-Whisper routing, silence timeouts, clean transcribe() contract. 

WYZER_DOCUMENTATION

Phase 4 — Brain (LLM)

Ollama + llama.cpp backend support, streaming responses, timeouts. 

WYZER_DOCUMENTATION

Phase 5 — TTS

Piper, interruptible barge-in, optional streaming TTS. 

WYZER_DOCUMENTATION

Phase 6 — Tools + Multi-intent

Stateless tools, JSON outputs, tool worker pool, multi-intent parser. 

WYZER_DOCUMENTATION

Phase 7 — Memory (controlled)

Explicit remember/forget/list, session memory, long-term storage + injection toggle. 

WYZER_DOCUMENTATION

Phase 8 — Performance + Reliability hardening

llama.cpp server management, GPU layers/threads tuning, watchdogs, “never stuck” behavior.
(You’ve already been working in this zone.) 

WYZER_DOCUMENTATION

Jarvis Feel Layer (next)
Phase 9 — Screen Awareness (NO OCR, read-only)

Goal: answer “what am I looking at” safely.

Foreground app/process + window title

Optional explicit screenshot capture only if you want it (still no OCR)

Inject “Visual Context (read-only)” text block into LLM prompts

Exit criteria

“What am I looking at?” answers using window title/app reliably.

Phase 10 — Continuity & Reference Resolver

Goal: follow-ups feel natural.

“close it”, “do that again”, “open that”, “the other one”

Use last_tool / last_target / active_app from a small world-state store

Exit criteria

“Open Chrome” → “close it” works.

Phase 11 — Opt-in Autonomy (confidence-driven)

Goal: stop asking when obvious, but stay safe.

Autonomy modes: off/low/normal/high

Thresholds decide: act vs ask vs defer to chat

Exit criteria

High-confidence commands execute instantly; unclear ones ask 1 question.

Phase 12 — Declarative Automations (rules, still safe)

Goal: “When X happens, do Y” without UI automation.

Time-based and internal-state-based rules first

Examples: scheduled reminders, “when I start speaking mute music”

Exit criteria

User can create/disable/list rules reliably.

Phase 13 — UI / Tray + Observability

Goal: usability + trust.

Tray icon, quick toggles (hotword, TTS, autonomy, suggestions)

Logs viewer, “why did you do that” audit trail

Exit criteria

Non-technical user can operate Wyzer without terminal.
